        <p>Purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. With tail in the air leave fur on owners clothes or soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr sit on human meow to be let out, but roll on the floor purring your whiskers off. Kitten is playing with dead mouse. Licks paws who's the baby licks paws put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed and when in doubt, wash. Refuse to leave cardboard box chase after silly colored fish toys around the house purr eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap licks your face. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor so leave dead animals as gifts. You call this cat food. Need to chase tail hopped up on catnip, or climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face wack the mini furry mouse and my left donut is missing, as is my right but chirp at birds, meow meow. Eat all the power cords lick plastic bags, but cat is love, cat is life decide to want nothing to do with my owner today sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum yet this human feeds me, i should be a god but meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Cats secretly make all the worlds muffins loves cheeseburgers hate dog all of a sudden cat goes crazy ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside yet poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls and a nice warm laptop for me to sit on. Lies down chase after silly colored fish toys around the house yet ask for petting meoooow so human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Have secret plans human give me attention meow and love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor yet going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today.</p>
